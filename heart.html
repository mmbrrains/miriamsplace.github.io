            Thus did I hear. At one time the Bhagavan was abiding at Vulture Peak
            in Rajagrha with a great assembly of monks and a great assembly of
            bodhisattvas. At that time, the Bhagavan entered into a samadhi on the
            categories of phenomena called "perception of the profound." Also at
            that time, the bodhisattva, the mahiisattva, the noble Avalokitesvara
            beheld the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom and saw
            that those five aggregates also are empty of intrinsic existence. Then, by
            the power of the Buddha, the venerable Sariputra said this to the
            bodhisattva, the mahiisattva, the noble Avalokitesvara, "How should a
            son of good lineage who wishes to practice the profound perfection of
            wisdom train?" He said that and the bodhisattva, the mahiisattva, the
            noble Avalokitesvara said this to the venerable Sariputra, "Sariputra, a
            son of good lineage or a daughter of good lineage who wishes to practice
            the profound perfection of wisdom should perceive things in this way:
            form is empty; emptiness is form. Emptiness is not other than form; form
            is not other than emptiness. In the same way, feeling, discrimination,
            conditioning factors, and consciousnesses are empty. Therefore, Sariputra,
            all phenomena are empty, without characteristic, unproduced, unceased,
            stainless, not stainless, undiminished, unfilled. Therefore, Sariputra, in
            emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no discrimination, no conditioning
            factors, no consciousness, no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body,
            no mind, no form, no sound, no odor, no taste, no object of touch,
            no phenomenon, no eye constituent up to and including no mental
            consciousness constituent, no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance, no
            aging and death up to and including no extinction of aging and death.
            In the same way, no suffering, origin, cessation, path, no wisdom, no
            attainment, no nonattainment. Therefore, Sariputra, because bodhisattvas
            have no attainment, they rely on and abide in the perfection of wisdom;
            because their minds are without obstruction, they have no fear. They
            pass completely beyond error and go to the fulfillment of nirvaQ.a. All
            the buddhas who abide in the three times have fully awakened into
            unsurpassed, complete, perfect enlightenment in dependence on the
            perfection of wisdom. Therefore, the mantra of the perfection of wisdom
            is the mantra of great knowledge, the unsurpassed mantra, the mantra
            equal to the unequaled, the mantra that completely pacifies all suffering.
            Because it is not false, it should be known to be true. The mantra of the
            perfection of wisdom is stated thus: [o1!1} gate gate paragate parasa7!1gate
            bodhi svaha. Sariputra, a bodhisattva mahasattva should train in the
            profound perfection of wisdom in that way." Then the Bhagavan rose
            from samadhi and said, "Well done" to the bodhisattva, the mahasattva,
            the noble Avalokitesvara. "Well done, well done, child of good lineage, it
            is like that. It is like that; the practice of the profound perfection of
            wisdom is just as you have taught it. Even the tathagatas admire it." The
            Bhagavan having so spoken, the venerable Sariputra, the bodhisattva, the
            mahasattva, the noble Avalokitesvara, and all those surrounding, and
            the entire world, the gods, humans, demigods, and gandharvas, admired
            and praised the speech of the Bhagavan.
